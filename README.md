# CSE017
CSE017 Junior year Fall semester.
This is all my coding projects, homework, exams, ect. for the class CSE017 at Lehigh University

CSE017 Description:
This course will cover the design and implementation of algorithms and data structures
using Java. It assumes that students have had prior experience using conditional
statements, loops, arrays, object-oriented programming, in Java, and will build on this
knowledge to learn algorithmic techniques such as recursion, algorithm analysis, and
sorting, and the design and implementation of data structures such as lists, queues,
stacks, trees, and hash tables.
